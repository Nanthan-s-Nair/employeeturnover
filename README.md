Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to predict employee attrition in a company using both Random Forest and Neural Network models. Employee attrition, or the rate at which employees leave the organization, is a critical concern for companies, and predicting it can help in workforce planning and management.
Also this model is kept open till accuray to show the efficiency of the model and can be further modified or developed accordingly the users requirements.

Overview
This project preprocesses a dataset containing employee information, identifies relevant features, and implements two models for attrition prediction: 

Random Forest and Neural Network. The code provides users with the ability to compare the performance of these models in predicting whether an employee is likely to leave or not.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the code.
then you can easily copy and paste this code and check on your sample data
NOTICE :please ensure that your table and keys of your csv file matches the requirements in code or can be altered according to the users requirements before actully running the code as it might produce invalid column or key error.

Usage
Run the main script to execute the employee attrition prediction models.

The project involves training two models:
Random Forest and Neural Network.

Random Forest
Tune hyperparameters and train the Random Forest model.

Neural Network
Train the Neural Network model.

Results
Presented below are the accuracy results obtained from both models on the validation and test sets.
Accuracy on the test set: 0.8371
